# Opinionated
A slack bot devoted to generating engagement and conversation amidst technologists

## Theory
Provided questions that span a wide range of topics such as technology, leadership, teamwork, and agile, we may facilitate company engagement and conversations that provide opportunities to share experience and insights, or even correct faulty thinking around core company practices and beliefs. 

## Experiment
Create a slack bot, `opinionated`, that will pose a weekly question to an opt-in slack channel of employees from across the company. Then monitor the level of engagement and the resulting conversation over the coming months.

### Example Questions:
- “AWS, Azure, or GCP? Tell me about your favorite features, greatest successes, and worst horror stories!”
- “Consultant or contractor? How does the answer to that question clarify the why, shape the how, and give meaning to the what of your work?”
